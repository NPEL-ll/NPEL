Dr. Jacob Valerian discovers a method for transferring memories and experiences into another person's brain. As his last dying act, he transfers his own memories into Karl's brain. Karl begins to have flashes of skill and talent from absorbing the doctor's memories. When he accidentally kills another man, he uses the device to transfer the man's memories into his own brain. However, this causes Karl to exhibit multiple personality and schizoid behavior. Meanwhile he tries to date a woman he's secretly loved for years, with no success, and is forced to kill and \"absorb\" the detective investigating about the death of the man Karl accidentally killed. Finally he absorbs the mind of an artist that the woman had a fling with hoping that his personality helps him to finally get her to love him. The artist was temperamental and suicidal. The ending sequence shows Karl kneeling on the floor going crazy with a gun pointed to his head. The final scene shows a photo of Rose with Karl apparently committing suicide off-camera. </td>",

After this, the visitor explains to Jake and a woman who witnessed the violence his reason for coming to Earth, and giving them this power. Jake asks him, \"All of these people, dead, for what?\" He then shows them that he is an alien, and tells them that he is scouting ahead to see if humans will ever be able to rival his civilization. \"The fate of a world isn't determined by its best examples, but by its worst. It takes a few to destroy the many, especially when even the best of you can be dragged down into the mire. Judging from your example, brother against brother, friend against friend, you people have such a potential for violence, sheer, unvarnished wickedness, I've got every confidence you'll destroy yourself before you build your first interstellar engine. We've got nothing to fear from you.\" He then disappears. </td>",

He gives four outlaws a special energy power, which they can use to destroy anything they wish as long as they \"want it more than anything else.\" The first outlaws to be given these powers are two friends, Frank and JD Kelton. Frank wants to use them to rob people. Later in the episode, the visitor gives the powers to two brothers, Jake and Ben Miller who use them to rival their ex-partners.
